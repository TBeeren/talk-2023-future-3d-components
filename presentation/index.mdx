<!--
Hi everyone! Thanks for being here today! I hope you all are as excited as me to dive into the 3D space of the web! So, let's dive into it.
-->

import twitter from '../assets/twitter.jpg'

<img src={twitter} style={{ width: '60vh' }} />

<!--
So a while ago I was bored so I started scrolling on Twitter or X or whatever?
While ignoring loads of tweets by Elon, this tweet caught my eye:
-->

---

import rug from '../assets/small-rug.jpeg'

<img src={rug} style={{ width: '80vh' }} />

<!--
This sad guy called Adam bought a carpet online, thinking it would be a big carpet.
However, after delivery founding out it was the perfect size to wipe his tears of disappointment.
-->

---

import reviews from '../assets/reviews.jpeg'

<img src={reviews} style={{ width: '60vh' }} />

<!--
The other part that stood out to me is that someone was happy enough to give it a 5 star review haha.
-->

---

# Expectations vs Reality

<!--
So this is a perfect example of how the expectation is different than the reality. And this is a big topic within online purchases.
Customers look at a couple pictures online, maybe a couple specifications and last but not least some reviews - and decide whether or not to buy it.

However, how do you really know what you've ordered?
-->

---

import rabbitHoles from '../assets/rabbit_hole.png'

<img src={rabbitHoles} style={{ width: '80vh' }} />

<!--
And well, I have to admit, that I've been having way to much joy diving into this rabbit hole of these issues.
-->

---

import reddit from '../assets/reddit.gif'

<img src={reddit} style={{ width: '80vh' }} />

<!--
And while scrolling through the comments of this tweet, I found a link into a sub-reddit where loads of people share their disappointing online purchases.
It mostly stood out to me that the problem is that big, that there is an entire community around it.

Because you know, whenever there will be a sub-reddit created for a specific thread - it's real.
-->

---

import cat from '../assets/small-cat.jpeg'

<img src={cat} style={{ width: '65vh' }} />

<!--
This little guy also looks really disappointed by his new toy.
-->

---

One of the biggest problems in online shopping

<!--
And while diving into the numbers, it's actually one of the biggest problems in e-commerce.
-->

---

import reasons from '../assets/reasons-of-return.png'

<img src={reasons} style={{ width: '80vh' }} />

<!--
It's actually one of the primary reasons why people return their order - since the `product received looks different`.
-->

---

# How do we match the expectation?

<!--
So, how do we match the expectation to be closer to the reality?
-->

---

import closed from '../assets/closed.jpg'

<img src={closed} style={{ width: '80vh' }} />

<!--
So before getting to the real problem, let's go back to the start of 2020.
Covid started to spread, and loads of physical stored started to close down.
-->

---

import covid from '../assets/impact_covid.jpeg'

Impact of covid-19 on commerce

<img src={covid} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

<!--
Because of that, loads of niches were impacted.
In this graph we're seeing the impact of Covid-19 on the overall sales being made offline and online.
-->

---

import covidZoom1 from '../assets/impact_covid_zoom1.jpeg'

<img src={covidZoom1} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

<!--
In there you'll see that quite some grew such as supermarkets,
in which 100% is normal and the additional 60% was basically me buying toilet paper.
-->

---

import toiletpaper from '../assets/toiletpaper.gif'

<img src={toiletpaper} style={{ width: '60%' }} />

---

import covidZoom2 from '../assets/impact_covid_zoom2.jpeg'

<img src={covidZoom2} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

<!--
But more interestingly enough, are the ones that didn't do well. For tourism and entertainment we already know the reasons,
but let's look into the 3rd most affected, which is jewelry
-->

---

import watch from '../assets/watch.jpeg'

<img src={watch} style={{ width: '100%' }} />

<!--
Imagine having a big interest into expensive watches,
I'd like too see hands, who of you would dare to buy a piece of 2k online? 👋🏼
Haha alright, well this is basically the problem they encountered as well
-->

---

import cartier from '../assets/cartier.mp4'
import cartierLogo from '../assets/cartier_logo.svg'

<img src={cartierLogo} style={{ width: '20%', marginBottom: '20px' }} />

<video
  src={cartier}
  autoPlay
  loop
  style={{ width: '100%' }}
/>

<!--
Well, so because of this issue - Cartier had to be innovative. Due to Covid, customers could not see the time piece in the physical store,
so they started experimenting with 3D models to bring the expectation closer to the reality, which ended up gaining trust from their audience
which resulted in a boost of conversion and reduction in returns.
-->

---

import shopifyLogo from '../assets/shopify_logo.svg'
import shopifyAr from '../assets/shopify_ar.jpeg'

<img src={shopifyLogo} style={{ width: '20%', marginBottom: '20px'}} />
<img src={shopifyAr} style={{ width: '100%', display: 'block', margin: 'auto' }} />

<!--
Another example is Shopify. As they also saw this problem occurring from their clients using shopify as store.
So they created a feature for their Shopify+ members to add a 3D view of their product.
-->

---

import shopifyLogo from '../assets/shopify_logo.svg'
import dogs from '../assets/shopify-dogs.png'

<img src={shopifyLogo} style={{ width: '20%', marginBottom: '20px'}} />
<img src={dogs} style={{ width: '70%', display: 'block', margin: 'auto' }} />

<!--
One of the stores who tried this feature, was Gunner Kennels - which is known for their `Kennels`.
A research paper from Shopify shows how this 3D/AR feature reduced their returns by 5% and boosted conversions by 40%.
-->

---

import shopifyLogo from '../assets/shopify_logo.svg'
import fashion from '../assets/shopify-fashion.png'

<img src={shopifyLogo} style={{ width: '20%', marginBottom: '20px'}} />
<img src={fashion} style={{ width: '70%', display: 'block', margin: 'auto' }}  />

<!--
So they tried it with other partners, and found an overall positive trend where conversion tends to boost and returns decline - based on the niche.
-->

---

# How does this work?

<!--
So this is cool right? It looks promising, so it sparked my curiosity into the real question
'How do we create these 3D components on the web?'
-->

---

import applePreview from '../assets/apple-preview.mp4'

<video
  src={applePreview}
  autoPlay
  loop
  style={{ width: '100%' }}
/>

<!--
So as a real researcher, I started by looking at our competitors.
And I have to confess, I’m one of these guys who goes quite often to the Apple website - not to buy an item -
but to look at their amazing web animations.

And so I did it again, to check how they do their 3d animations on scroll. Awesome, isn't it?
-->

---

import appleNetwork from '../assets/apple-network.mp4'

<video
  src={appleNetwork}
  autoPlay
  loop
  style={{ width: '100%' }}
/>

<!--
And surprisingly enough I found out that it’s not a real model,
but they’re rendering images on scroll - as you can see here in the networking tab.
-->

---

import canon from '../assets/canon.mp4'

<video
  src={canon}
  autoPlay
  loop
  style={{ width: '100%' }}
/>

<!--
And while diving further into this space I found a javascript library which people used to create stunning 3d websites.
Here are some examples:

And yeah, they might have put all their into creating the 3D experience and not that much into the buggy text 😆
